      <p><br>My favourite person is someone who inspires me every day. This person has a kind personality and always treats others with respect. I admire their positive attitude and the way they handle challenges calmly. They are supportive, understanding, and always willing to help. Their words encourage me to stay motivated and improve myself. I enjoy spending time with them because they make me feel comfortable and valued.
