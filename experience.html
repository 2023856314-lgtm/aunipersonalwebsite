      <h3 style="margin-top:12px">Internship</h3>
	<p>During my internship, I had the opportunity to work in a professional environment where I learned many new skills. I assisted with daily tasks, managed basic administrative work, and supported the team when needed. This experience helped me improve my communication, time management, and problem-solving skills. I also gained confidence working with different people and handling responsibilities independently.
